Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.35,0:11:47.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Because it's a recursive acronym.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.55,0:11:50.55,Default,,0,0,0,,It stands for "GNU's Not Unix".
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.65,0:11:53.75,Default,,0,0,0,,You see so the "G" in "GNU" stands for "GNU".
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.75,0:11:55.85,Default,,0,0,0,,And what the name means is
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.85,0:12:00.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I was developing a system that was like the Unix operating system,

Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.65,0:12:08.55,Default,,0,0,0,,because Unix was proprietary.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.65,0:12:11.63,Default,,0,0,0,,We were forbidden to share Unix, We couldn't use Unix.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.63,0:12:14.15,Default,,0,0,0,,It was useless for a community.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.25,0:12:17.75,Default,,0,0,0,,So we had to write a replacement for it.

Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.05,0:12:35.95,Default,,0,0,0,,it was based upon the Unix kernel which had been licensed from AT&T.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.05,0:12:40.75,Default,,0,0,0,,However, due to legal problems with AT&T and fragmentation of the source code,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.95,0:12:44.55,Default,,0,0,0,,hackers and other non-institutional users were slow to adopt it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.75,0:12:48.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Unix consisted of a large number of separate programs
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.75,0:12:50.85,Default,,0,0,0,,that communicated with each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.95,0:12:53.85,Default,,0,0,0,,So we just had to replace these programs one by one.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.95,0:12:57.65,Default,,0,0,0,,So what I started doing was writing a replacement for one program,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.75,0:12:59.55,Default,,0,0,0,,and then another, and then another,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.55,0:13:01.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and then people started joining me,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.45,0:13:05.05,Default,,0,0,0,,because I published an announcement inviting other people to join me
Dialogue: 0,0:13:05.15,0:13:06.75,Default,,0,0,0,,to help write these programs.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.05,0:13:14.45,Default,,0,0,0,,And uh... and by around 1991, we had replaced practically all of them.

Dialogue: 0,0:43:00.05,0:43:04.05,Default,,0,0,0,,The role of my paper was essentially to make the internal case at Netscape, uh

Dialogue: 0,0:43:08.35,0:43:11.95,Default,,0,0,0,,The paper was called "Netscape Source Code As Netscape Product".

Dialogue: 0,0:43:17.25,0:43:18.45,Default,,0,0,0,,In my opinion we needed to
Dialogue: 0,0:43:18.55,0:43:22.35,Default,,0,0,0,,think of source code not just as something that was used in creating our products,
Dialogue: 0,0:43:22.35,0:43:24.55,Default,,0,0,0,,but as something that was a product in its own right.

Dialogue: 0,0:43:49.25,0:43:53.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I used Eric's paper as an example of how distributed development could work,

Dialogue: 0,0:50:23.55,0:50:28.75,Default,,0,0,0,,and to say Open Source is a software that gives you a list of nine rights
Dialogue: 0,0:50:28.75,0:50:31.05,Default,,0,0,0,,which is in the Open Source definition.
Dialogue: 0,0:50:32.05,0:50:34.85,Default,,0,0,0,,The first right is Free Redistribution

Dialogue: 0,0:50:37.25,0:50:39.45,Default,,0,0,0,,It means liberty

Dialogue: 0,0:50:50.05,0:50:52.25,Default,,0,0,0,,It has to come with source code
Dialogue: 0,0:50:52.55,0:50:55.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So that someone can maintain a program.

Dialogue: 0,0:51:12.45,0:51:17.25,Default,,0,0,0,,uh, There is a provision about integrity of the author's source code
Dialogue: 0,0:51:17.45,0:51:22.35,Default,,0,0,0,,which says that the author can sort of maintain their honor
Dialogue: 0,0:51:22.35,0:51:26.85,Default,,0,0,0,,and if you make a change you might have to change the name of the program
Dialogue: 0,0:51:26.85,0:51:29.55,Default,,0,0,0,,or mark out your change very clearly
Dialogue: 0,0:51:29.55,0:51:32.95,Default,,0,0,0,,so that your change doesn't reflect on the author
Dialogue: 0,0:51:32.95,0:51:36.75,Default,,0,0,0,,There is no discrimination against people or groups.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:36.85,0:51:38.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh, the example I usually use is
Dialogue: 0,0:51:39.35,0:51:41.85,Default,,0,0,0,,You can't stop an abortion clinic
Dialogue: 0,0:51:41.85,0:51:45.05,Default,,0,0,0,,or an anti-abortion activist from using the software
Dialogue: 0,0:51:45.05,0:51:49.05,Default,,0,0,0,,There is no discrimination against fields of endeavor
Dialogue: 0,0:51:49.05,0:51:55.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And that means the software has to be usable in a business as well as in a school
Dialogue: 0,0:51:55.55,0:51:58.85,Default,,0,0,0,,The license has to be distributable
Dialogue: 0,0:51:58.95,0:51:59.95,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words
Dialogue: 0,0:52:00.15,0:52:03.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I have to be able to give that license to someone
Dialogue: 0,0:52:03.35,0:52:09.45,Default,,0,0,0,,and that license then should work if that someone gives it to yet a third person
Dialogue: 0,0:52:09.45,0:52:13.25,Default,,0,0,0,,The license can't be specific to a product
Dialogue: 0,0:52:13.25,0:52:14.45,Default,,0,0,0,,in other words
Dialogue: 0,0:52:14.45,0:52:19.65,Default,,0,0,0,,if I distribute my software on a Red Hat system
Dialogue: 0,0:52:19.65,0:52:21.25,Default,,0,0,0,,the license can't say:
Dialogue: 0,0:52:21.25,0:52:24.95,Default,,0,0,0,,you can't distribute this on a SuSE or Debian system
Dialogue: 0,0:52:24.95,0:52:28.45,Default,,0,0,0,,The license can't contaminate other software
Dialogue: 0,0:52:28.45,0:52:34.85,Default,,0,0,0,,So if I distribute this on a CD with another program
Dialogue: 0,0:52:34.85,0:52:40.95,Default,,0,0,0,,It can't say that other program must be free otherwise you can't distribute my software
Dialogue: 0,0:52:40.95,0:52:47.65,Default,,0,0,0,,And then the only other part of the Open Source definition is a list of licenses that were accepted
Dialogue: 0,0:52:47.65,0:52:51.55,Default,,0,0,0,,And the ones that we started with were the GPL
Dialogue: 0,0:52:51.55,0:52:58.15,Default,,0,0,0,,which was actually the example for a lot of what's in the Open Source definition in the BSD license
Dialogue: 0,0:52:58.15,0:53:02.15,Default,,0,0,0,,because software for BSD system pre-existed Linux
Dialogue: 0,0:53:07.95,0:53:11.75,Default,,0,0,0,,I think the next moment that I thought was really pivotal
Dialogue: 0,0:53:11.75,0:53:13.95,Default,,0,0,0,,was when the database vendors flipped over
Dialogue: 0,0:53:13.95,0:53:17.05,Default,,0,0,0,,which happened about three months sooner than I expected to
Dialogue: 0,0:53:17.05,0:53:19.45,Default,,0,0,0,,and actually happened in late July early August
Dialogue: 0,0:53:19.45,0:53:26.55,Default,,0,0,0,,commitments to do one ports from Oracle and and Sybase and the other key database vendors.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:26.55,0:53:27.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[ And why was that critical? ]
Dialogue: 0,0:53:27.85,0:53:32.25,Default,,0,0,0,,because we knew that in order for the open source story to be credible
Dialogue: 0,0:53:32.25,0:53:34.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and especially in order for the Linux story to be credible,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:34.95,0:53:37.95,Default,,0,0,0,,we'd have to get commitments from independent software vendors
Dialogue: 0,0:53:37.95,0:53:41.45,Default,,0,0,0,,to do ports of their applications to these platforms.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:41.45,0:53:44.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And I was actually kind of worried
Dialogue: 0,0:53:44.05,0:53:46.45,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought that we were in a window of vulnerability
Dialogue: 0,0:53:46.45,0:53:49.85,Default,,0,0,0,,between the time that we announced the open source campaign
Dialogue: 0,0:53:49.85,0:53:51.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and the database vendors flipped over
Dialogue: 0,0:53:51.65,0:53:57.95,Default,,0,0,0,,that was the point at which hostile action by Microsoft or other close-source software companies
Dialogue: 0,0:53:57.95,0:54:01.75,Default,,0,0,0,,that was the point in which a serious marketing blitz might have sunk us
Dialogue: 0,0:54:01.75,0:54:05.75,Default,,0,0,0,,but once the big database vendors flipped over
Dialogue: 0,0:54:05.75,0:54:08.25,Default,,0,0,0,,that opened the way for other ISVs
Dialogue: 0,0:54:08.25,0:54:10.15,Default,,0,0,0,,that started the snow ball effect going
Dialogue: 0,0:54:10.15,0:54:12.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Every six months or so
Dialogue: 0,0:54:12.25,0:54:13.85,Default,,0,0,0,,I would come back to the venture capitalists

Dialogue: 0,0:54:21.05,0:54:24.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And our customer list was getting much more impressive
Dialogue: 0,0:54:24.35,0:54:26.95,Default,,0,0,0,,It was people like Cisco that were beginning to appear

Dialogue: 0,0:54:43.75,0:54:47.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, at that point, the venture capitalists couldn't ignore it
Dialogue: 0,0:54:48.15,0:54:51.05,Default,,0,0,0,,they just got sick of hearing about Linux everywhere

Dialogue: 0,0:54:56.35,0:55:00.75,Default,,0,0,0,,So they uh, they decided it was time to invest, that there was something happening
Dialogue: 0,0:55:00.75,0:55:04.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I announced Open Source to the world on the Internet
Dialogue: 0,0:55:04.25,0:55:11.15,Default,,0,0,0,,I did a lot of the early... administrative work of starting the Open Source Initiative
